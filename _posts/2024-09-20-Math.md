To be able to build strong foundations, it is imperative to understand the underlying math. To do exactly this, I'd be using the [Mathematical Methods For Physicists | Arfken Weber & Harris](https://www.amazon.in/s?k=mathematical+methods+for+physicists&adgrpid=1327112142208717&hvadid=82944779185731&hvbmt=be&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=149547&hvnetw=o&hvqmt=e&hvtargid=kwd-82945386912940%3Aloc-90&hydadcr=23577_2291778&msclkid=bf855bc750281ffe12293d2ba834a88f&tag=msndeskstdin-21&ref=pd_sl_9j551xo7f6_e).
