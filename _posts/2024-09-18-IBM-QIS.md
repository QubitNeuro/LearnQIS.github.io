To start making contributions as soon as possible, it is imperative that I dig into the main field of my interest, i.e, QIS right in. To do this I will complete the lectures from IBM Quantum learning series as soon possible and start working on the project. After this I will move to the main textbook by [Nielsen and Chuang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Computation_and_Quantum_Information).
